# How to use: 
Add TextToSpeechClass.java to your project <br/>
Add the class to manifest 

import statement <br/>
`object = new TextToSpeechClass(getApplicationContext(), "Opening message");`

Speak function <br/>
`object.speak("message")`

Still working on bugs with speechtotext, main issue is that both classes run <br/>
    at the same time so the speech to text picks up text to speech voice commands <br/>
    when not wearing headphones. <br/>
    
If you import the whole project the speechtotext.java is not working yet. <br/>
Also you should wear headphones <br/>

## Valid commands:  <br/>
Go to <br/>
Take me <br/>
Room <br/>
Yes <br/>
No <br/>
Set up <br/>
Commands <br/>
Stop <br/>
